/**
*	PURP
*	Invite All Friends to Like a Page on Facebook.
*
*	BENEFITS
*	1.	Save yourself from wasting time and doing mundane taks of hitting invite
*		button for all friends to invite them to like your page, because you can
*		use this script to automate the process of sending invites to your friends.
*
*	2. 	This script solves the problem of getting blocked due to going too fast,
*		which is usually the case with other scripts, by slowing down the process
*		of unfriending by moving intermittently at every 2.5 second.
*
*
*	SAFETY
*	This script is completely safe and did work excellently.
*	
*
*	INSTRUCTIONS TO USE
*	Step 1: 	Login to your facebook account on laptop in chrome browser.
*	Step 2: 	Go to the facebook page for which you want to send invites.
*	Step 3:		Click 'Invite your friends' and wait until popup box loads well.
*	Step 4:		Pres Ctrl+Shift+J, to open browser console.
*	Step 5:		Open this file in a text editor, and copy all the contents of this
*				file using Ctrl+A and Ctrl+C.
*	Step 5: 	Paste the copied contents into browser console using Ctrl+V.
*	Step 6:		After pasting press Enter.
*	Step 7:		Get yourself a pizza, and sit back and eat while the script does its magic.
*	Step 8:		Find me on facebook, and send your thanks and follow me on instagram. 
*				Comeon Man, I saved your time and effort, and only asking for a Thanks and follow!
